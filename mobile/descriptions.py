    Abstract =  "To support the research community in investigating our malignant mesothelioma multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) dataset, we created the web resource providing interactive visualizations mIF and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) images of tumor samples. More specifically, our interactive web resource includes mIF images from tissue microarrays (TMAs, n=3) of samples from patients with malignant peritoneal and pleural mesothelioma (MPeM and MPM, respectively) to elucidate the spatial distributions of major immune cell populations and their association with LAG3, BAP1, NF2, and MTAP expression, the latter as a proxy for CDKN2A/B. Our web resource provides unique and valuable data for testing hypotheses about malignant mesothelioma tumor immune microenvironment that could facilitate the understanding of pathogenesis and identify novel therapies.."
